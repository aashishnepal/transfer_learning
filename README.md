# Transfer Learning Project

This project demonstrates the use of transfer learning to classify images. We leverage a pre-trained model (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) and fine-tune it for our specific classification task. This README provides an overview of the steps followed, based on the tutorial from [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ml-introduction-to-transfer-learning/).

## Overview

Transfer learning allows us to use a pre-trained model (trained on a large dataset like ImageNet) as a starting point for a new task. Instead of training a model from scratch, we fine-tune the pre-trained model on our specific dataset. This approach is beneficial when we have a limited amount of labeled data.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
```

## Dataset

For this project, we used a custom dataset consisting of images classified into different categories. The dataset was split into training and validation sets.

- **Training Set:** 80% of the data
- **Validation Set:** 20% of the data

## Model Architecture

We utilized the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. The model was modified by adding custom layers for our classification task. Here is a summary of the model architecture:

1. **Base Model:** VGG16 (without the top layers)
2. **Custom Layers:**
   - Flatten Layer
   - Dense Layer with 256 units and ReLU activation
   - Dropout Layer with a rate of 0.5 to prevent overfitting
   - Dense Layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification
   - (Optional) Dense Layer with sigmoid activation for binary classification

### Code Snippet

```python
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import RMSprop

# Load the VGG16 model without the top layers
conv_base = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=(224, 224, 3))

# Freeze the layers up to block4_pool
for layer in conv_base.layers:
    if 'block4' not in layer.name and 'block5' not in layer.name:
        layer.trainable = False

# Build the model
model = models.Sequential()
model.add(conv_base)
model.add(layers.Flatten())
model.add(layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'))
model.add(layers.Dropout(0.5))
model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax'))  # Use 'softmax' for multi-class classification

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer=RMSprop(learning_rate=1e-5),
              loss='categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```

## Training

The model was trained using the following configuration:

- **Optimizer:** RMSprop with a learning rate of 1e-5
- **Loss Function:** Categorical Crossentropy for multi-class classification
- **Metrics:** Accuracy
- **Epochs:** 20
- **Batch Size:** 32

### Command to Train the Model

```python
history = model.fit(train_ds, epochs=20, validation_data=validation_ds, verbose=2)
```

## Results

After training, the model achieved an accuracy of approximately 25.49% on the validation set. The accuracy can be further improved by:

- Fine-tuning more layers of the pre-trained model
- Experimenting with different hyperparameters
- Using data augmentation and regularization techniques
